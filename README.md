# AlphadokuSolver

How to Run:
Download the folder somehow (git, zip, flash drive, hacking, etc.) and make sure the folder is able to be accessed by a terminal. Follow these instructions to run (note that I use a linux command line):

1.	Make sure that Python3, pip3, pysat, and any other packages related to pysat are installed.

2.	Open a console in the same directory as the files.

3.	Run the space with the following command:

   	a.	Python3 alphaSolver.py

4.	The results will be displayed on screen as seen below:

    a.	The name of the test will appear on the first line.
    
    	i.	Ex. Start Test :alpha_5.txt
  
  	b.	If the Alphadoku problem is solved, the solved problem will appear
  
  	c.	If the Alphadoku is unique, the phrase “Solution is Unique” will appear
    
    	i.	See below for further discussion
  
  	d.	If the Alphadoku problem is solved, the word “Success” will appear
  
  	e.	If the Alphadoku problem is unsolvable, the next word “Failure” will appear with no problem.
